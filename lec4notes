A in ACID?
Atomicity

Atomicity guarentees?
Either all operations succeed or none of them

Given a failure free computer, is atomicity free?
No, an application might back out part way through the transaction. For example, +100 from account A, then realize that account B doesn't have succifient funds.

C in ACID?
Consistency

What is consistency?
State transitions start from a consistent state and end in a consistent state. For example, every employee must have a salary. Requires database has understanding of the semantics of the data.

I in ACID?
Isolation

What is isolation?
Concurrent transactions appear to execute sequentially.

D in ACID?
Durability

What is durability?
Once a transaction commits, then even after a machine restart the transaction side effects are there.

What about durability when disks fail?
RAID or replication.

When is data durable?
When the data is stored on secondary storage that doesn't require a power source.

Transfer()
01: A_bal := Read(A)
02: A_bal := A.bal - $50
03: Write(A, A_bal)
04: B_bal := Read(B)
05: B_bal := B.bal + $50
06: Write(B, B_bal)
07: Commit()

Crash between 00 & 01?
Client nevers receives commit message so you know transaction didn't succeed.
?=== What if client fails? ===?

Crash between 02 & 03?
Only in memory has changed. Persisted version is correct.

Crash between 03 & 04?
Account A loses $50 and it vanishes.

Crash during 03?
Data corruption since step 03 isn't necessarily atomic.

Crash after 06?
Safe for transaction to commit or abort. Depends on whether commit message was written to disk.

ReportSum()
01: A_bal := Read(A)
02: B_bal := Read(B)
03: Print(A_bal + B_bal)

What if run ReportSum 01-03 in between Transfer 01 & 02?
No side effects from Transfer. As though ReportSum ran first, Transfer second.

What if run ReportSum 01-03 in between Transfer 03 & 04?
Inconsistent state since side effects for A but not for B. Application invariant is violated.

What if run ReportSum 01-03 in between Transfer 06 & 07?
Application invariant upheld but transaction could still abort. ReportSum shows imaginary numbers.
?=== Nested transaction problem is mentioned @32:06 ===?

What if run ReportSum 01 between Transfer 02 & 03 and ReportSum 02-03 between T05&06?
Same as ReportSum then Transfer.

What is a conflict between transactions?
Two operations to a data element and at least one is a write.

What are the conflicts between Transfer and ReportSum?
T03 & RS01 and T06 & RS02.

What is required for transactions to run concurrently?
Conflicts between transactions are ordered consistently.

What is serializability?
The side effects of transactions adhere to some sequential ordering of transactions.


What is a transaction operation schedule?
Partial ordering of the operations performed by a set of transactions

Why is a schedule only partially ordered?
Non-conflicting operations can be concurrent (e.g. reads and non-conflicting writes)

What is the difference between a partial order vs a total order?
In a total order, all items can be ordered. In partial order, some items can be concurrent.

When are two schedules equivalent?
When the order of the conflicting operations are the same.

Serial schedule: r0[A] -> w0[A] -> r0[B] -> w0[B] -> c0 -> r1[A] -> r1[B] -> c1?
Yes, there is no interleaving of operations.


Serial schedule: r0[A] -> w0[A] -> r1[A] -> r0[B] -> w0[B] -> c0 -> r1[B] -> c1?
Yes, the order of the conflicting operations (w0[A] & r1[A] and w0[B] & r1[B]) are the same as the non-interleaved ordering where t0 finishes first.


Serial schedule: r0[A] -> w0[A] -> r1[A] -> r1[B] -> c1 -> r0[B] -> w0[B] -> c0?
No, the order of w0[A] & r1[A] and w0[B] & r1[B] are not consistent (first: t0 -> t1, second: t1 -> t0)

What is required to get isolation in ACID?
Serialiazable schedules.

How to get serializable schedules?
Locking.

Enforces isolation: before r/w take lock after r/w release lock?
No, r0[A] -> w0[A] -> r1[A] -> r1[B] -> c1 -> r0[B] -> w0[B] -> c0

Enforces isolation: start of tx take locks for all r/w, release after commit?
Yes, but txs that have conflicts will not interleave operations (not allowed: r0[A] -> w0[A] -> r1[A] -> r0[B] -> w0[B] -> c0 -> r1[B] -> c1)

What is two-plase locking?
In the acquire locks phase, grab r/w lock as needed. Only enter release locks phase when no additional locks will be acquired. Release locks when no longer needed.

What type of schedules does two-phase locking guarentee?
Serializable schedules

Are all serializable schedules obtainable with two-phase locking?
No

What is an example of a serializable schedule that two-phase locking prevents?
r0[A] -> w0[A] -> r1[A] -> r0[B] -> w0[B] -> c0 -> r1[B] -> c1

Does two-phase locking avoid deadlocks?
No, w0[A] -> w1[B] -> w0[B] -> w1[A]

Databases have in-memory and on-disk representations, how to ensure durability?
Write-ahead log of undo or redo operations.

When is an undo needed in a write-ahead log?
On-disk data is changed before commit (might happen when working set doesn't fit in memory)

When is a redo needed in a write-ahead log?
In-memory data is changed but on-disk isn't. Redo to ensure change in event of crash.

Are undos/redos in write-ahead log always valid?
No unless there is a commit for the tx in write-ahead log.

Why does write-ahead log provide atomicity?
Undo and redo operations will ensure that on-disk data either applies missing changes (redos) or removes aborted changes (undos). Thus either the entire tx is applied or nothing.

How to ensure that commit in write-ahead log is atomic?
Only report tx success when buffer is flushed to disk.

What is an approach to get atomicity and durability in ACID?
Use write-ahead log.


Scenario: Partitioned database. Each partition is ACID.

If tx spans partitions, can client send commit to each part to ensure distributed tx?
No, ptx0 succeeds but ptx1 aborts. Now side effects of ptx0 are visible even though distributed tx has aborted.

Why does a distributed transaction require at least two phases?
The first phase must ask the participants if they can commit.

What is an atomic commitment protocol?
A protocol where there is one single moment in time that transitions all participants from pre-commit to post-commit.

Why is an single node ACID tx an atomic commitment protocol?
The single moment in time that transitions pre to post-commit is when a commit message is writtent to the write-ahead log.

Atomic commitment protocol: what guarantees if all processes reach a decision?
That they reach the same decision.


Atomic commitment protocol: can a process change its decision?
No, once a process has reached a decision it cannot change it. This would violate atomicity and durability.


Atomic commitment protocol: what happens if a single process votes "NO"?
The tx must be aborted otherwise atomicity is lost.


Atomic commitment protocol: what is the decision if there are no failures and all processes vote "YES"?
The decision will be "COMMIT" (rules out the trivial abort implementation).

Atomic commitment protocol: after failure when will all proceses eventually reach a decision?
If all failures are repaired and no new failures occur for a sufficiently long period.

What is the uncertainty period?
In 2PC, if a node votes "YES" then it can no longer unilaterally abort. Instead it must wait until hearing from the coordinator. This time period is the uncertainty period.

What is independent recovery?
The ability for a failed node to recover with only local state.

Is independent recovery possible in atomic commitment procotols?
Not in all cases. If in an uncertainty period, then the node cannot just abort. Instead it must communicate with another node but due to the impossibility result this communication might be delayed arbitrarally long.

Atomic commitment protocol: is it guarenteed that all processes will eventually reach a decision?
No, a node could fail forever or repeatably fail.


Atomic commitment protocol: will all non-faulty processes eventually reach a decision?
No, non-faulty processes might depend upon faulty processes.


Atomic commitment protocol: if all processes vote YES then a commit decision be reached?
No, network failures (lost packets or timeouts) can prevent the coordinator from seeing all the votes. In these cases, the coordinator must abort.

2PC
1. Coordinator sends PREPARE to all participants
2. When a participant receives a PREPARE, it responds with a YES o NO. If the participant votes NO, it can immediately abort
3. Coordinator collects votes
	-if all were YES (including coordinators) then coordinator (a) decides to COMMIT (b) sends COMMIT messages to each participant
	-otherwise: (c) decides to ABORT, (d) sends ABORT messages to each participant that voted YES
4. Participants that voted YES wait for message from coordinator. When it receives one, it decides accordingly and stops

What if a process never receives a PREPARE message?
It can always abort outside of the uncertainty period.

What if coordinator doesn't recieve votes from all processes before timeout?
It should just abort (assume that unreceived votes are NOs).

What if a participant votes YES and timeouts waiting for a COMMIT/ABORT decision?
This is the uncertainty period. Must wait for confirmation from either coordinator or other process.

Can a participant make a decision if it knows that the coordinator is down and all other participants are in their uncertainty period?
No, the coordinator can still come up and issue a decision.

What is the atomic moment in time when 2PC commits?
When the coordinator stores the COMMIT decision to disk.

Does the coordinator have to record that it sent PREPARE to all participants?
Can safely abort after failure.

Does a participant have to record that it is voting YES?
Yes, since it must know that it is in the uncertainty period after failure.

What does a participant guarentee when it votes YES?
That it will accept the decision from the coordinator.

Does a participant have to record that it is voting NO?
Unless there is a YES recorded then a participant can just abort after failure.

Does the coordinator have to record YES votes?
No, can safely assume ABORT after failure?

Does the coordinator have record anything before sending COMMIT messages to participants?
Yes it must store a COMMIT message before sending COMMIT message to any participants. Otherwise atomicity and durability are violated.

Does the coordinator have to record anything before sending ABORT messages to participants?
No, can safely assume ABORT after failure.

When is it safe for a participant to prune its write-ahead log in 2PC?
After it has enacted all side effects. It can be useful to preserve COMMITs so that other participants can ask for decision when coordinator is unavailable.

When is it safe for the coordinator to prune its write-ahead log in 2PC?
It can prune non-COMMITs after enacting side effects. It can prune COMMITs after side effects are enacted across all participants.
